# Suicide-Rate-Analysis

World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around one million people die from suicide every year i.e. one death every 40 seconds. 55% of them are aged between 15 to 44 years and 45% are aged 45 years and over. 
 
 The number is supposed to be fortunately dropping. 
 
 In this dataset, I want to explore which age group of people have been the victim of it the most considering there demographical      and biographical information.
 
 Secondly, if the suicide rate has been increasing or decreasing and how it is getting affected. 
 
 This analysis will give us insights and lead to possible measures that we can take to counter this problem.
